Build me a fully off-chain RWA (Real-World Asset) tokenization and trading platform using Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + React.
This platform should NOT use blockchain, NOT use Polygon, and NOT deploy ERC-3643 on-chain — it should only follow ERC-3643-like compliance logic internally (KYC, permissions, identity-linked accounts).
The system should mimic tokenization logic but store all states in the database.

🎯 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Build:

Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)

Frontend: React + Tailwind

Authentication: JWT + Role-based access

Asset Management: CRUD assets (properties, commodities, loans)

Tokenization: Mint internal “tokens” representing fractions of assets

Compliance Rules:

Each investor must have KYC-approved profile

Transfers only allowed between verified users

Admin can freeze/unfreeze accounts

Admin can revoke tokens

Secondary Market: Peer-to-peer trading inside the platform

Audit Trail: Every transfer must be logged (like on-chain events)

No blockchain. No wallet. No on-chain fees. Everything stored in PostgreSQL.

📌 DATABASE STRUCTURE REQUIRED

Create PostgreSQL tables:

users

id

name

email

passwordHash

role (ADMIN / INVESTOR)

kycStatus (PENDING / APPROVED / REJECTED)

isFrozen (boolean)

createdAt

assets

id

type (real_estate / commodity / loan)

title

description

totalSupply (integer)

remainingSupply

navPrice

createdAt

tokens

id

assetId

ownerId

amount

frozen (boolean)

orders (for secondary market)

id

sellerId

buyerId (nullable)

assetId

tokenAmount

pricePerToken

status (OPEN / FILLED / CANCELLED)

createdAt

transfers

id

assetId

fromUser

toUser

tokenAmount

timestamp

reason (TRANSFER / FREEZE / UNFREEZE / ADMIN_REVOKE)

📌 BACKEND ENDPOINTS TO GENERATE
Auth

POST /auth/register

POST /auth/login

GET /users/me

KYC + Admin

GET /admin/users

POST /admin/users/:id/approve

POST /admin/users/:id/reject

POST /admin/users/:id/freeze

POST /admin/users/:id/unfreeze

Assets

POST /assets

GET /assets

GET /assets/:id

PUT /assets/:id

Tokenization (off-chain)

POST /tokens/mint

POST /tokens/revoke

GET /tokens/user/:id

Transfers

POST /tokens/transfer (respect compliance rules)

Secondary Market

POST /marketplace/order

POST /marketplace/order/:id/fill

POST /marketplace/order/:id/cancel

GET /marketplace/orders

📌 COMPLIANCE RULES TO IMPLEMENT

When minting, transferring, or trading tokens:

Both parties must be KYC APPROVED

Both parties must be not frozen

Seller must own enough tokens

Admin can block any user or revoke tokens

Transfers must be logged in audit table

No public blockchain interactions

This should replicate ERC-3643 logic off-chain.

Use Tailwind, clean UI, and fetch data from Express API.

📌 DELIVERABLES

Ask Replit AI to generate:

✔ Full backend folder structure
✔ Prisma schema + migrations
✔ REST API controllers
✔ Middleware (auth, roles, compliance checks)
✔ React frontend with forms + tables
✔ Simple state management (Context or Zustand)
✔ Fully working secondary market logic
✔ Dummy seed data
✔ Instructions to run the project

📌 NON-REQUIREMENTS

DO NOT include:

Smart contracts

Blockchain

Web3 wallets

MetaMask

RPCs

Polygon

On-chain ERC-3643 tokens

Everything must be off-chain simulation only.
